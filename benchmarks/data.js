          "message": "fix: critical memory leak from per-session database connections (#554)\n\n* fix: critical memory leak from per-session database connections (#542)\n\nEach MCP session was creating its own database connection (~900MB),\ncausing OOM kills every ~20 minutes with 3-4 concurrent sessions.\n\nChanges:\n- Add SharedDatabase singleton pattern - all sessions share ONE connection\n- Reduce session timeout from 30 min to 5 min (configurable)\n- Add eager cleanup for reconnecting instances\n- Fix telemetry event listener leak\n\nMemory impact: ~900MB/session → ~68MB shared + ~5MB/session overhead\n\nCo-Authored-By: Claude Opus 4.5 <noreply@anthropic.com>\nConceived by Romuald Czlonkowski - https://www.aiadvisors.pl/en\n\n* fix: resolve test failures from shared database race conditions\n\n- Fix `shutdown()` to respect shared database pattern (was directly closing)\n- Add `await this.initialized` in both `close()` and `shutdown()` to prevent\n  race condition where cleanup runs while initialization is in progress\n- Add double-shutdown protection with `isShutdown` flag\n- Export `SharedDatabaseState` type for proper typing\n- Include error details in debug logs\n- Add MCP server close to `shutdown()` for consistency with `close()`\n- Null out `earlyLogger` in `shutdown()` for consistency\n\nThe CI test failure \"The database connection is not open\" was caused by:\n1. `shutdown()` directly calling `this.db.close()` which closed the SHARED\n   database connection, breaking subsequent tests\n2. Race condition where `shutdown()` ran before initialization completed\n\nConceived by Romuald Członkowski - www.aiadvisors.pl/en\n\nCo-Authored-By: Claude Opus 4.5 <noreply@anthropic.com>\n\n* test: add unit tests for shared-database module\n\nAdd comprehensive unit tests covering:\n- getSharedDatabase: initialization, reuse, different path error, concurrent requests\n- releaseSharedDatabase: refCount decrement, double-release guard\n- closeSharedDatabase: state clearing, error handling, re-initialization\n- Helper functions: isSharedDatabaseInitialized, getSharedDatabaseRefCount\n\n21 tests covering the singleton database connection pattern used to prevent\n~900MB memory leaks per session.\n\nConceived by Romuald Członkowski - www.aiadvisors.pl/en\n\nCo-Authored-By: Claude Opus 4.5 <noreply@anthropic.com>\n\n---------\n\nCo-authored-by: Claude Opus 4.5 <noreply@anthropic.com>",
